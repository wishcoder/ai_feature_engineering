* Wiki Pages


## Application

### 1. Incident Forecasting (For - Upper Management, Application Support, Developers)
* **Data Preparation:** Aggregate historical incident data, including timestamps, severity, duration, affected components, and resolution details. System metrics and change logs from Code Repositories should be cleaned and labeled with common identifiers to correlate changes with incidents.
* **Model Selection:** Use Time Series Forecasting models like ARIMA, SARIMA, or LSTM (for nonlinear patterns) for forecasting incidents. Anomaly Detection models can include Isolation Forest or Autoencoders to identify unusual patterns indicating potential incidents.
* **Training Process:** Train the forecasting model on historical data, using a time-based split to validate the model's performance. For anomaly detection, training involves feeding the model with "normal" operational data and testing it with data containing known anomalies to tune its sensitivity.
* **Deployment Strategy:** Deploy the model in a monitoring system where it continuously receives new data, updating its forecasts and detecting anomalies in real time. Alert mechanisms should be in place for when the model predicts a high likelihood of an incident. 
* **Benefit:** Predict the likelihood of future incidents based on patterns, such as number of application dependencies, or specific component vulnerabilities. This can help in proactive resource allocation and incident prevention.

### 2. Root Cause Analysis For - Application Support, Developers)
* **Data Preparation:** Collect and preprocess incident reports, system logs, and operational data. This includes natural language processing steps like tokenization, stemming, and removal of stop words for textual data, and normalization for numerical system logs.
* **Model Selection:** NLP models could range from simpler TF-IDF with Logistic Regression to more complex models like BERT for understanding incident reports. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are used to model the system's component relationships and dependencies.
* **Training Process:** Train the NLP model on a labeled dataset of incident reports categorized by root cause. The GNN model is trained on a graph representing the system architecture, where nodes are components, and edges represent dependencies, using known incidents to learn patterns.
* **Deployment Strategy:** Integrate the models into the incident management workflow. When a new incident is reported, the system uses the NLP model to analyze the description and the GNN model to consider system dependencies, aiding in root cause identification.
* **Benefit:** Analyze past incidents and identify common factors or sequences of events that often lead to issues. This can improve the speed and accuracy of root cause identification for new incidents.

### 3. Predictive Incident Management in Incident Management System (For - Upper Management, Application Support, Developers)
* **Data Preparation:** Similar to Task 1, focus on incident reports, resolution times, and characteristics. Ensure data is clean and structured for time series analysis.
* **Model Selection:** Time series forecasting models, as mentioned in Task 1, are appropriate here. Choose the model based on the data's characteristics (e.g., seasonality, trend).
* **Training Process:** Train the model on historical incident data, using cross-validation to assess its predictive accuracy. Adjust the model parameters based on performance metrics like MAE (Mean Absolute Error) or RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
* **Deployment Strategy:** Implement the model within the Incident Management System to provide forecasts of potential incidents. Use these forecasts to inform resource planning and preventive measures.
* **Benefit:** Predict and identify potential future incidents before they occur, allowing preemptive action. This can help in resource allocation and minimizing downtime.

### 4. Automated Ticket Triaging in Bug Tracking System (For - Management, Developers)
* **Data Preparation:** Extract features from historical tickets, including description text, priority, and resolution time. Preprocess text data for NLP tasks.
* **Model Selection:** Classification models like Random Forest, SVM, or neural networks for categorizing tickets. NLP techniques are used to convert text to a format understandable by the model.
* **Training Process:** Train the model on a labeled dataset where each ticket is tagged with its correct category and priority. Use text vectorization methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings for feature extraction from ticket descriptions.
* **Deployment Strategy:** Integrate the model into the Bug Tracking System to automatically categorize and prioritize incoming tickets. Regularly retrain the model with new data to maintain accuracy.
* **Benefit:** Automatically categorize and prioritize incoming tickets based on their content, historical data, and urgency. This reduces manual triaging workload and speeds up response times.

### 5. Code Quality and Bug Prediction in Code Repositories (For - Developers)
* **Data Preparation:** Analyze commit history, code changes, and bug tickets. Extract features like code complexity metrics, the frequency of commits, and historical bug rates.
* **Model Selection:** Machine learning models suitable for classification or regression tasks, depending on whether you're predicting the likelihood of a bug (binary) or estimating bug risk (continuous).
* **Training Process:** Train the model on historical data, using code metrics and past bug occurrences as input features. Validate the model's performance using a separate test set.
* **Deployment Strategy:** Implement the model in the CI/CD pipeline to assess code quality and bug risk for new commits or pull requests. Provide feedback to developers as part of the code review process.
* **Benefit:** Predict potential bugs in code commits or pull requests before they are merged, based on historical bug data and code changes. This can significantly reduce the bug rate and improve code quality.

### 6. Automated Resolution Suggestions for Incidents (For - Application Support, Developers)
* **Data Preparation:** Collect historical incident reports and resolutions. Process text data and structure it for analysis, linking incidents to resolutions and relevant code changes or bug tickets.
* **Model Selection:** Use NLP models for understanding incident descriptions and recommendation systems to suggest resolutions based on similarity to past incidents.
* **Training Process:** Train the NLP model on incident descriptions to extract meaningful features. The recommendation system learns from past incidents and their successful resolutions to suggest applicable fixes.
* **Deployment Strategy:** Integrate this system into the Incident Management System so that when a new incident is reported, the system automatically suggests potential resolutions.
* **Benefit:** Provide automated resolution suggestions for new incidents by learning from past incidents and their successful resolutions. This can speed up incident resolution times.

### 7. Cross-Platform Analytics and Insights (For - Upper Management)
* **Data Preparation:** Integrate data from Code Repositories, Bug Tracking System, and Incident Management System. Ensure consistent labeling across platforms to connect related data points.
* **Model Selection:** Data integration tools and analytical models, possibly including predictive models, to analyze trends and patterns across the data.
* **Training Process:** No traditional training process here, but configure the analytical tools to correctly interpret and correlate data from different sources.
* **Deployment Strategy:** Develop a dashboard or reporting tool that provides insights into project health, developer productivity, and incident trends. Use these insights for strategic decision-making and improvement initiatives.
* **Benefit:** Gain comprehensive insights into project health, developer productivity, incident trends, and more. This holistic view can help in strategic decision-making and identifying areas for improvement.
